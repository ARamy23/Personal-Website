                I started my journey with Computers back when I was 5, always
                been fascinated by all those moving bits that ends up as a
                spaceship game or angry chicken flying around üêî <br /> <br /> 
                And that passion about Computers never faded, whether movies, games,
                interactive stories, or even the internet, there was always
                someting to admire about them <br /> <br /> 
            </p>

            <p>
                And as years went on, that curiousness about how these things work has led me to watch a
                video about programming, the moment I compiled something with a bunch of if, else, switches and loops, I knew I found my new
                addiction <br />  <br /> 
                
                So you can say 2016 was the year of pivoting, I was in
                High School, I started taking CS50 course, there I e-met
                wonderful people, Dr. Malan, Doug Lloyd, and many others of the
                staff and the community that am so grateful to have met and
                learned from
