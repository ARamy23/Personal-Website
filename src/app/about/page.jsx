  paragraph1: `
    My journey with computers began at the tender age of five, and I've been hooked ever since. 
    I was always fascinated by how those moving bits and bytes could turn into a spaceship game or an angry chicken flying across the screen. 
    One of my earliest programming memories was solving the <strong>"Mario" problem</strong>, and the joy I felt at that moment became my gateway into the world of programming.
  `,
  paragraph2: `
    Soon enough, I was diving into building a <strong>Tower of Hanoi</strong> game in Java and experimenting with HTML and CSS. 
    My inspiration came from my love for the game <a href="https://www.warframe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warframe</a>, which fueled my creativity to build text adventures in CLI tools using C++. 
    There was always something to admire in these digital creations, whether movies, games, or interactive stories.
  `,
  paragraph3: `
    However, the journey wasn't without its challenges. I often found myself wanting to try <em>everything</em>, leading to distractions. 
    Despite this, I persisted, driven by my insatiable curiosity about how things work. In 2016, while in high school, I took the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50 course</a>, 
    where I met incredible people like <strong>Dr. Malan</strong> and <strong>Doug Lloyd</strong>. Their teachings and the supportive community around me solidified my passion for technology.
  `,
  paragraph4: `
    Today, I'm a <strong>Senior Engineer</strong>â€”soon to be <strong>Staff Engineer</strong>â€”where my role involves leading teams and experimenting with new technologies. 
    I find joy in guiding others through ambiguity, and my journey doesn't stop there. My current challenge is to venture into course-making and maintain my blog, 
    sharing knowledge beyond the confines of my company.
